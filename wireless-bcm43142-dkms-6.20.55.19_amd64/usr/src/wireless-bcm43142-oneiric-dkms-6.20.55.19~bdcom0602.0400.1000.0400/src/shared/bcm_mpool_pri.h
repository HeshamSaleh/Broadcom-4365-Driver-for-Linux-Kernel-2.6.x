 * Memory pool type definitions
 *
 * Prealloc memory pools:
 *    These memory pools are memory allocators based on subdividing a single
 *    block of memory into homogenous objects. It's suitable for data structures
 *    with a statically configured maximum # of objects, such as using tunable
 *    parameters. It's not suitable for heterogenous data structures nor for
 *    data structures where the maximum count is unbounded.
 *
 *    Since the memory for all the objects is preallocated during initialization,
 *    that memory is unavailable to the rest of the system. This is appropriate both for
 *    small data structures, and for medium/large data structures where the peak and average
 *    utilization are similar. For data structures where average utilization is low but peak
 *    is very high, it's better to use the real heap so the memory gets freed when it's
 *    not in use.
 *
 *    Each individual memory pool can obtain it's memory from the user/client
 *    code or from the heap, as desired.
 *
 *
 * Heap memory pools:
 *    The memory pool allocator uses the heap (malloc/free) for memory.
 *    In this case, the pool allocator is just providing statistics and instrumentation
 *    on top of the heap, without modifying the heap allocation implementation.
 *
 * The memory pool component consists of two major abstractions:
 *     Manager: the factory for memory pools
 *     Pool: an individual pool that can allocate objects
 *
 * The memory pool manager maintains an array of individual pools so that instrumentation
 * can examine and manage all of them globally.
